#### Some Classes:

Priest - low damage, low defenses, but is able to heal itself

Wizard - high dmg,low health, low defenses (think: glass cannon)

Knight - high defense, low attack, high health (think: tank)

#### On to the monsters!

Golem - A feisty one. Lots of damage and health. Be careful if you encounter him.

Ogre - Your "Average Joe" monster. Nothing too overpowered, with balanced stats.

Ogre Priest - The annoying monster that doesn't do too much damage, but cements itself as an irritation with its healing. Attrition is recommended here.
